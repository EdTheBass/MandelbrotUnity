# MandelbrotUnity
Mandelbrot Set implemented in Unity

Used Unity's compute shaders to make the mandelbrot set run big fast.

### Controls

- `Up/down/left/right` - navigate the mandelbrot set  
- `+` - scroll out  
- `-` - scroll in  
- `J` - switch between the Mandelbrot Set and the Julia sets  
- `W` (only for Julia sets) - increase the real part of the Julia set parameter  
- `S` (only for Julia sets) - decrease the real part of the Julia set parameter  
- `D` (only for Julia sets) - increase the imaginary part of the Julia set parameter  
- `A` (only for Julia sets) - decrease the imaginary part of the Julia set parameter  

For a direct executable check the latest release.

The code attached to this may take some effort to get running in your own Unity environment - I've only added it for people to read.
For your own sake I recommend you don't try to build it yourself and instead use the executable (although if you really don't trust me you can do it yourself).
